heading: Who's Vlad?

  My name is Vlad and I’m running for the 37th Assembly District seat. My story from immigrant to business owner wouldn’t be possible without access to a public school and a train to take me there. As I’ve seen New York evolve throughout the years, I’ve also witnessed it’s public systems get left behind. It is time we give them the attention and updates they deserve!

        I was born in Ukraine and my family immigrated to Brooklyn when I was nine years old. My parents, immigrants from a non-English speaking country, worked long hours at low paying jobs to support and give me and my sister opportunities that they did not have.

        I went to Stuyvesant High School, followed by New York University, and then spent a decade founding and growing my very own business.

        In the second year of college, I founded a company that repairs consumer electronics. We grew over the years, and this eventually allowed me to find a place to proudly call my home in Hunter’s Point. Here, I enjoy spending my weekends at our beautiful Gantry Plaza Park, often walking with my dog-son Bernard.

        The pandemic was a unique time for everyone. As a business owner, I felt not just the initial impact, when the world seemingly came to a halt, but also the government’s actions that followed. Contradicting regulation between the City and State, constantly changing mask policies, and disorganized vaccination rollouts are just some of the things every business had to deal with on a daily basis just to stay safe and in compliance. Our government failed us in the greatest time of need.

    I am running for State Assembly to make an impact on the role the government plays in its relationship with the people that it’s meant to serve. I want to love the place I call home, and enable the same for others. To do that, we need to: expand on education, re-design our decaying infrastructure using a first-principles approach, and re-establish public safety.
