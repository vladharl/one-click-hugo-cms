blurb:
    heading: Who's Vlad?
    text: "My name is Vlad and I’m running for the 37th Assembly District. My story from immigrant to business owner wouldn’t be possible without access to a public school and a train to take me there. As I’ve seen New York evolve throughout the years, I’ve also witnessed its public systems get left behind. It is time we give them the attention and updates they deserve!"
intro:
    heading: "About Vlad"
    text: "I was born in Ukraine and my family immigrated to Brooklyn when I was nine years old. My parents, immigrants from a non-English speaking country, worked long hours at low paying jobs to support and give my sister and me opportunities they never had."

      text: "In the second year of college, I founded a company that repairs consumer electronics. We grew over the years, and this eventually allowed me to find a place to proudly call my home in Hunter’s Point. Here, I enjoy spending my weekends at our beautiful Gantry Plaza Park, often walking with my dog-son Bernard. "

    text: New York is a special place to live and work in. What has worked well in the past years, hasn't been maintained or updated to the current times. Our public services require the attention of our government. WE'RE READY FOR AN UPDATE
