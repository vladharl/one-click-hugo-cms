    heading: Who's Vlad?
    text: "My name is Vlad and I’m running for the 37th Assembly District seat. My story from immigrant to business owner wouldn’t be possible without access to a public school and a train to take me there. As I’ve seen New York evolve throughout the years, I’ve also witnessed it’s public systems get left behind. It is time we give them the attention and updates they deserve!"

      text: "In the second year of college, I founded a company that repairs consumer electronics. We grew over the years, and this eventually allowed me to find a place to proudly call my home in Hunter’s Point. Here, I enjoy spending my weekends at our beautiful Gantry Plaza Park, often walking with my dog-son Bernard. "

    text: New York is an amazing place to live and work in. Queens' tight-knit community is unique and is the foundation of positive change. However, a lack of attention from our government in the recent years demands action.
